# AGENT ROUTER (EXECUTE FIRST)

Follow this router before any action. Do not explore outside the relevant README.

**IF** task involves [CUSTOMIZE: your common patterns - e.g., "database queries, API calls, form validation"] →
→ **Read `docs/AI_DOMAIN_TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` FIRST** (quick reference for project patterns)
→ Then read domain-specific documentation if needed
→ Work in: [CUSTOMIZE: relevant directories]

**IF** task involves [CUSTOMIZE: known limitations - e.g., "image processing, API timeouts, large file operations"] →
→ **Check `docs/AI_CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITS.md` FIRST** (capability thresholds + workarounds)
→ Then proceed with appropriate workaround
→ Work in: [CUSTOMIZE: relevant directories]

**IF** user asks about AI guides system, maintaining guides, or how to use translation/capabilities guides →
→ **Read `docs/AI_GUIDES_USAGE_SUMMARY.md` FIRST** (quick start - how system works)
→ **For maintenance**: `docs/AI_GUIDES_MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md` (when/how to update guides)
→ **Three-command workflow** (systematic maintenance):
  - `/ai-guides-discover [scope]` - Find patterns/limits/anti-patterns after completing work
  - `/ai-guides-assess [item_ids]` - Score materiality with objective framework (40 points)
  - `/ai-guides-update [item_ids]` - Execute updates with quality control
  - See: AI_GUIDES_MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md → "Operational Maintenance Workflow" section
→ **For validation**: Run `bash tools/validate_ai_guides.sh` (monthly health check)
→ **The two guides**:
  - `docs/AI_DOMAIN_TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md` - Quick pattern lookup
  - `docs/AI_CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITS.md` - Tool limits and workarounds
→ **Key insight**: Guides are living documents - update when workflows change (monthly validation required)

[CUSTOMIZE: Add your domain-specific routing rules below]

**IF** task mentions [CUSTOMIZE: domain 1 keywords - e.g., "authentication, users, sessions"] →
→ **Open `[CUSTOMIZE: path/to/README.md]`** and follow it
→ Work in: [CUSTOMIZE: relevant directories]

**IF** task mentions [CUSTOMIZE: domain 2 keywords - e.g., "API endpoints, routes, controllers"] →
→ **Open `[CUSTOMIZE: path/to/README.md]`** and follow it
→ Work in: [CUSTOMIZE: relevant directories]

**IF** task mentions [CUSTOMIZE: domain 3 keywords - e.g., "components, UI, styling"] →
→ **Open `[CUSTOMIZE: path/to/README.md]`** and follow it
→ Work in: [CUSTOMIZE: relevant directories]

**IF** general/exploratory task →
→ Continue reading this file

**AFTER completing significant work** →
→ **Consider running**: `/ai-guides-discover conversation` to find patterns worth documenting
→ **Then**: `/ai-guides-assess` to score materiality (CRITICAL items = update immediately)
→ **Purpose**: Prevent guide staleness, capture patterns while fresh, systematic maintenance
→ **Don't run if**: One-off task, already documented, trivial operation (<30s impact)

**ALWAYS respect repo rules**:
[CUSTOMIZE: Add your project-specific rules - e.g., "No secrets in git", "Always run tests before commit"]
